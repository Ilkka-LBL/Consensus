Welcome to Consensus's documentation!
=====================================

Welcome! This is the index page for the Consensus package. 

The package's name is a reference to the central idea of connecting many public APIs used by UK institutions and local authorities. It is no coincidence that one of these APIs is of course Nomis where most of us access UK Census data and creating a connection to which was the main impetus for implementing this package in the first place.
