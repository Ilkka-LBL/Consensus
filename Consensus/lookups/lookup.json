Census data for these areas (previously called urban areas) has been produced every 10 years since 1981. A new methodology to capture the areas has been used in the 2011 version, but it follows the rules used in previous versions so that results will be broadly comparable. As before, the definition follows a \u2018bricks and mortar\u2019 approach, with built-up areas defined as land with a minimum area of 20 hectares (200,000 m2), while settlements within 200 metre of each other are linked. There are 337 BUA where population has not been allocated (305 in England, 32 in Wales) and 133 BUASD where population has not been allocated (123 in England, 10 in Wales). The names and codes of these areas are included in the metadata accompanying the digital boundaries. This file contains the nine character coding only. For more information, please see the Code History Database (CHD) (link below). The built-up area boundaries area generalised and created using an automated approach based on a 50m grid squares. When viewing these boundaries in the map viewer, the names will only show when the scale is set to 1:15,000 or below.

Local authority districts (LAD) is a generic term to describe the 'district' level of local government in Great Britain. It includes non-metropolitan districts, metropolitan districts, unitary authorities and London boroughs in England; Welsh unitary authorities; and Scottish council areas. The areas are made up of whole electoral wards\/divisions. This product contains both the nine character codes as well as the old style four character codes. For further information, please see the Code History Database (CHD) (Link below). The boundaries are Intermediate\/Generalised (20m). Intermediate datasets are designed for high quality mapping, preserving much of the original detail from the full dataset, but typically 10% of the file size. They are great when used in conjunction with the OS raster products and for producing detailed regional and local maps, or large wall maps. They are also suitable for non-demanding GIS analyses (such as buffering). Intermediate datasets are a good compromise between detail and small file size. They have also been clipped to the clipped to the coastline (Mean High Water mark), giving the coastline a more orthodox appearance. Please note that this product contains both Ordnance Survey and ONS Intellectual Property Rights","134":"This file contains the digital vector boundaries for clinical commissioning groups in England as at April 2013. Clinical commissioning groups (CCG) are NHS organisations set up by the Health and Social Care Act 2012 to organise the delivery of NHS services in England. They are clinically led groups that include all of the general practice groups in their geographical area. The aim of this is to give GP and other clinicians the power to influence commissioning decisions for their patients. CCG will be overseen by NHS England (including its Regional Offices and Area Teams). These structures will manage primary care commissioning, including holding the NHS Contracts for GP Practices NHS. Groups have boundaries that are coterminous with those of lower layer super output areas. This file contains the nine character coding only. For more information, please see the Code History Database (CHD) (link below). Super generalised boundaries are designed for national mapping where high levels of detail are not required. They have very small file sizes which also makes them suitable for mapping on the web. They should not be used for GIS analyses. They have also been clipped to the coastline (Mean High Water mark), giving the coastline a more orthodox appearance.

Census data for these areas (previously called urban areas) has been produced every 10 years since 1981. A new methodology to capture the areas has been used in the 2011 version, but it follows the rules used in previous versions so that results will be broadly comparable. As before, the definition follows a \u2018bricks and mortar\u2019 approach, with built-up areas defined as land with a minimum area of 20 hectares (200,000 m2), while settlements within 200 metre of each other are linked. Built-up area sub-divisions are also identified to provide greater detail in the data, especially in the larger conurbations. There are 337 BUA where population has not been allocated (305 in England, 32 in Wales) and 133 BUASD where population has not been allocated (123 in England, 10 in Wales). The names and codes of these areas are included in the metadata accompanying the digital boundaries. This file contains the nine character coding only. For more information, please see the Code History Database (CHD) (link below). The built-up area sub-division boundaries area generalised and created using an automated approach based on a 50m grid squares.

The file was created as part of a \u2018Pan-European' grid system. The grid contains 2011 Census data on total population and number of households for the United Kingdom and a break down by sex for England, Wales and Northern Ireland. This data is provided on the basis of the previously released postcode information from the Census where each postcode (and its associated data) is allocated to the GEOSTAT grid on the basis of its grid reference (point-in-polygon). Using the previously published data has allowed the publication of small counts for grid cells that may previously have been suppressed if there was a risk of disclosure. The file is in GRE format (grid, extent), meaning that is grid formed of equally sized cells which extends beyond the coastline. It can be used to aggregate statistics to equally sized 'areas\u2019. Please note that this product contains Eurostat, National Records of Scotland, Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency and ONS Intellectual Property Rights. The services for the GEOSTAT Grids are published in the ETRS 1989 LAEA projection. As the file is not in the British National Grid (BNG) projection, it may not line up with other spatial datasets.\u00a0<div><br \/><\/div><div>Download File Size - 18 MB.<br \/><div><br \/><\/div><div>REST URL of ArcGIS for INSPIRE View Service \u2013\u00a0<a href='https:\/\/ons-inspire.esriuk.com\/arcgis\/rest\/services\/Eurostat_Boundaries\/GEOSTAT_Grid_December_2011_Boundaries\/MapServer\/exts\/InspireView' target='_blank'>https:\/\/ons-inspire.esriuk.com\/arcgis\/rest\/services\/Eurostat_Boundaries\/GEOSTAT_Grid_December_2011_Boundaries\/MapServer\/exts\/InspireView<\/a>\u00a0<\/div><div><br \/><\/div><div>REST URL of ArcGIS for INSPIRE Feature Download Service -\u00a0<a href='https:\/\/ons-inspire.esriuk.com\/arcgis\/rest\/services\/Eurostat_Boundaries\/GEOSTAT_Grid_December_2011_Boundaries\/MapServer\/exts\/InspireFeatureDownload' style='line-height: 1.75667;' target='_blank'>https:\/\/ons-inspire.esriuk.com\/arcgis\/rest\/services\/Eurostat_Boundaries\/GEOSTAT_Grid_December_2011_Boundaries\/MapServer\/exts\/InspireFeatureDownload<\/a><\/div><\/div><div><br \/><\/div><div>REST URL of ArcGIS Feature Service -\u00a0<a href='https:\/\/ons-inspire.esriuk.com\/arcgis\/rest\/services\/Eurostat_Boundaries\/GEOSTAT_Grid_December_2011_Boundaries\/FeatureServer' target='_blank'>https:\/\/ons-inspire.esriuk.com\/arcgis\/rest\/services\/Eurostat_Boundaries\/GEOSTAT_Grid_December_2011_Boundaries\/FeatureServer<\/a><br \/><\/div>","511":"","512":"","513":"","514":"This file contains the digital vector boundaries for European Electoral Regions in Great Britain as at 31 December 2016.\n\nThe boundaries available are:<div><br \/><\/div><div><ul><li>Full resolution - extent of the realm (usually this is the Mean Low Water mark but in some cases boundaries extend beyond this to include off shore islands);<br \/><\/li><li>Full resolution - clipped to the coastline (Mean High Water mark);\u00a0<br \/><\/li><li>Generalised (20m) - clipped to the coastline (Mean High Water mark);<br \/><\/li><li>Super generalised (200m) - clipped to the coastline (Mean High Water mark) and<br \/><\/li><li>Ultra generalised (500m) - clipped to the coastline (Mean High Water mark).<br \/><\/li><\/ul><\/div><div><span style='font-size: 15px;'><br \/><\/span><\/div><div><span style='font-size: 15px;'>Contains both Ordnance Survey and ONS Intellectual Property Rights.<\/span><\/div><div><span style='font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif;

The top-level division of administrative geography in the United Kingdom is the four countries - England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. This file only contains information for Great Britain (nine-character GSS codes only). For further information, please see the Code History Database (CHD) (link contained within the metadata).  Super generalised boundaries are designed for national mapping where high levels of detail are not required. They have very small file sizes which also makes them suitable for mapping on the web. They should not be used for GIS analyses. They have also been clipped to the coastline (Mean High Water mark), giving the coastline a more orthodox appearance. Please note that this product contains both Ordnance Survey and ONS Intellectual Property Rights.  The map services on the Open Geography portal are published in the original British National Grid (BNG) projection. We recommend that in order to avoid anomalies of on the fly projections by different systems, you should use the service in a like-for-like projection space. The REST end-point map services are such that when you add the map service it is immediately recognised by the client (such as ArcMap or MapInfo) as BNG projection. The map services also have WMS services for those of you who wish to use WMS (27700 BNG and WGS84). BNG is the best option if you want a high degree of accuracy. If you choose not to use like-for-like then you are responsible for applying the proper geodetic datum transformations. The reason being that these transformations are not always going to be accurate and are affected by the bounding box (size), geographic location, and projection parameters of the data you are trying to view.\n","534":"","535":"","536":"This file contains the digital points for the Index of Place Names in Great Britain as at July 2016.\n\nContains both Ordnance Survey and ONS Intellectual Property Rights.\n","537":"","538":"","539":"FT_males_TTWA","540":"<span style='font-family: '>This file contains the lookup between Lower Layer Super Output Areas (LSOA) and Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) scores in England as at 31 December 2015. \u00a0(File Size - 1 MB)<\/span>","541":"","542":"<span style='font-family: '>This file contains the lookup between 2001 Data Zones (DZ) and Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) scores in Scotland as at 31 December 2012. \u00a0(File Size - 101 KB)<\/span>","543":"This file contains the digital vector boundaries for Fire and Rescue Authorities in England and Wales, as at December 2018.

Local authority districts (LAD) is a generic term to describe the 'district' level of local government in Great Britain. It includes non-metropolitan districts, metropolitan districts, unitary authorities and London boroughs in England; Welsh unitary authorities; and Scottish council areas. The areas are made up of whole electoral wards\/divisions. This product contains both the nine character codes as well as the old style four character codes. For further information, please see the Code History Database (CHD) (Link below). Super generalised boundaries are designed for national mapping where high levels of detail are not required.

The top-level division of administrative geography in the United Kingdom is the four countries - England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. This file only contains information for Great Britain. This product contains both the nine character codes as well as the old style three character codes. For further information, please see the Code History Database (CHD) (Link below). The boundaries are Intermediate\/Generalised (20m). Intermediate datasets are designed for high quality mapping, preserving much of the original detail from the full dataset, but typically 10% of the file size. They are great when used in conjunction with the OS raster products and for producing detailed regional and local maps, or large wall maps. They are also suitable for non-demanding GIS analyses (such as buffering). Intermediate datasets are a good compromise between detail and small file size. They have also been clipped to the clipped to the coastline (Mean High Water mark), giving the coastline a more orthodox appearance.

Local authority districts (LAD) is a generic term to describe the 'district' level of local government in Great Britain. It includes non-metropolitan districts, metropolitan districts, unitary authorities and London boroughs in England; Welsh unitary authorities; and Scottish council areas. The areas are made up of whole electoral wards\/divisions. This product contains both the nine character codes as well as the old style four character codes. For further information, please see the Code History Database (CHD) (Link below). The boundaries are Intermediate\/Generalised (20m). Intermediate datasets are designed for high quality mapping, preserving much of the original detail from the full dataset, but typically 10% of the file size. They are great when used in conjunction with the OS raster products and for producing detailed regional and local maps, or large wall maps. They are also suitable for non-demanding GIS analyses (such as buffering). Intermediate datasets are a good compromise between detail and small file size. They have also been clipped to the clipped to the coastline (Mean High Water mark), giving the coastline a more orthodox appearance. Please note that this product contains both Ordnance Survey and ONS Intellectual Property Rights.","801":"","802":"<span style='font-family: &quot;Avenir Next W01&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next W00&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next&quot;, Avenir, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;'>This file contains the digital vector boundaries for Local Authority Districts in the United Kingdom, as at 1 April 2019.

Please note that LAU 1 do not have the nine character codes as Eurostat use only their own seven character codes. The boundaries are Intermediate\/Generalised (20m). Intermediate datasets are designed for high quality mapping, preserving much of the original detail from the full dataset, but typically 10% of the file size. They are great when used in conjunction with the OS raster products and for producing detailed regional and local maps, or large wall maps. They are also suitable for non-demanding GIS analyses (such as buffering). Intermediate datasets are a good compromise between detail and small file size. They have also been clipped to the coastline (Mean High Water mark), giving the coastline a more orthodox appearance.

Local authority districts (LAD) is a generic term to describe the 'district' level of local government in Great Britain. It includes non-metropolitan districts, metropolitan districts, unitary authorities and London boroughs in England; Welsh unitary authorities; and Scottish council areas. The areas are made up of whole electoral wards\/divisions. This file contains the nine character coding as well as the old four character coding. For more information, please see the Code History Database (CHD) (link below). Super generalised boundaries are designed for national mapping where high levels of detail are not required. They have very small file sizes which also makes them suitable for mapping on the web. They should not be used for GIS analyses. They have also been clipped to the coastline (Mean High Water mark), giving the coastline a more orthodox appearance.

LAUs form part of a hierarchical classification of spatial units that provide a breakdown of the EU's territory for producing comparable regional statistics. LAU 2 replaced NUTS 5 in July 2003. They are made up of electoral wards\/divisions. There are 9817 LAU 2 areas in Great Britain. ONS have this product dated as at January 2012, but the official Eurostat terminology for this product is NUTS 2010. For further information on Eurostat dating of products, please see the link below. Please note that LAU 2 do not have the nine character codes as Eurostat use only their own ten character codes. The boundaries are Intermediate\/Generalised (20m). Intermediate datasets are designed for high quality mapping, preserving much of the original detail from the full dataset, but typically 10% of the file size. They are great when used in conjunction with the OS raster products and for producing detailed regional and local maps, or large wall maps. They are also suitable for non-demanding GIS analyses (such as buffering). Intermediate datasets are a good compromise between detail and small file size. They have also been clipped to the coastline (Mean High Water mark), giving the coastline a more orthodox appearance.

Inner London refers to the part of Greater London falling within the boundaries of the former London county. Outer London refers to the part of Greater London falling outside the boundaries of the former London county. The six metropolitan counties were administrative areas in England from 1974 to 1986, forming the upper tier of a two-tier local government structure. They were abolished in 1986, but are still used for statistical purposes. The non-metropolitan counties form the upper tier of the two-tier local government structure found in many parts of England.  Unitary authorities are areas with a single tier of local government. This file contains the nine character coding only for the geographies. For more information, please see the Code History Database (CHD) (link below). Super generalised boundaries are designed for national mapping where high levels of detail are not required. They have very small file sizes which also makes them suitable for mapping on the web. They should not be used for GIS analyses. They have also been clipped to the coastline (Mean High Water mark), giving the coastline a more orthodox appearance.

Inner London refers to the part of Greater London falling within the boundaries of the former London county. Outer London refers to the part of Greater London falling outside the boundaries of the former London county. The six metropolitan counties were administrative areas in England from 1974 to 1986, forming the upper tier of a two-tier local government structure. They were abolished in 1986, but are still used for statistical purposes. The non-metropolitan counties form the upper tier of the two-tier local government structure found in many parts of England.  Unitary authorities are areas with a single tier of local government. This file contains the nine character coding only for the geographies. For more information, please see the Code History Database (CHD) (link below). Super generalised boundaries are designed for national mapping where high levels of detail are not required. They have very small file sizes which also makes them suitable for mapping on the web. They should not be used for GIS analyses. They have also been clipped to the coastline (Mean High Water mark), giving the coastline a more orthodox appearance.

The 2001 Output Areas and Super Output Areas were maintained using 2011 Census data and are referred to as 2011 Output Areas and Super Output Areas.  The 34,753 Lower Layer SOAs in England (32,844) and Wales (1,909) were built from groups of Output Areas that were created in 2003 and maintained in 2011.  The LSOAs take into account the changes made at OA level and their boundaries are constrained to the 2011 Local Authority District boundaries.  These changes mean that where possible, the LSOAs stay within the minimum and maximum ranges.  They have a minimum of 1,000 residential population (an average of 1,600) and 400 households (an average of 650). The majority of Lower Layer SOAs have not changed since 2004, allowing time-series comparison of statistics at that level. Lower Layer SOAs are used as the building block for Middle Layer SOAs and several other geographies e.g. Cancer Networks.  The boundaries are Intermediate\/Generalised (20m). Intermediate datasets are designed for high quality mapping, preserving much of the original detail from the full dataset, but typically 10% of the file size. They are great when used in conjunction with the OS raster products and for producing detailed regional and local maps, or large wall maps. They are also suitable for non-demanding GIS analyses (such as buffering). Intermediate datasets are a good compromise between detail and small file size.  They have also been clipped to the clipped to the coastline (Mean High Water mark), giving the coastline a more orthodox appearance.

The 2001 Output Areas and Super Output Areas were maintained using 2011 Census data, and are referred to as 2011 Output Areas and Super Output Areas. Super Output Areas (SOAs) are a geographic hierarchy designed to improve the reporting of small area statistics. In consultation with local authorities, the 7,201 Middle Layer SOAs in England (6,791) and Wales (410) were built from groups of Lower Layer SOAs and are constrained by the 2011 local authority boundaries. They have a minimum of 5,000 residential population (an average of 7,700) and 2,000 households (an average of 3,200). Please note though that E02006781 (Isles of Scilly 001) is much smaller than this, but has been included as a pseudo-MSOA to give complete national coverage. The majority of Middle Layer SOAs have not changed since 2004, allowing time-series comparison of statistics at that level. Users should be aware of this when using MSOAs for statistical presentation. The boundaries are Intermediate\/Generalised (20m). Intermediate datasets are designed for high quality mapping, preserving much of the original detail from the full dataset, but typically 10% of the file size. They are great when used in conjunction with the OS raster products and for producing detailed regional and local maps, or large wall maps. They are also suitable for non-demanding GIS analyses (such as buffering). Intermediate datasets are a good compromise between detail and small file size. They have also been clipped to the clipped to the coastline (Mean High Water mark), giving the coastline a more orthodox appearance.

The Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics (NUTS) is a hierarchical classification of spatial units that provides a breakdown of the European Union's territory for the purposes of producing comparable regional statistics. There were originally 5 different NUTS levels but as from 11 July 2003, NUTS levels 4 and 5 became Local Administrative Units (LAU). The remaining NUTS levels 1-3 will be fixed for a few years but the LAU will not. NUTS and LAU are generally based on different levels of administrative geography. The 11 NUTS 1 areas in Great Britain comprise the nine Regions (Former GORs) in England, together with Scotland and Wales. ONS have this product dated as at January 2015, but the official Eurostat terminology for this product is NUTS 2013. For further information on Eurostat dating of products, please see the link below. Please note that NUTS do not have the GSS-nine character codes as Eurostat use only their own three character codes. Super generalised boundaries are designed for national mapping where high levels of detail are not required. They have very small file sizes which also makes them suitable for mapping on the web. They should not be used for GIS analyses. They have also been clipped to the coastline (Mean High Water mark), giving the coastline a more orthodox appearance. Please note that this product contains both Ordnance Survey and ONS Intellectual Property Rights.  The map services on the Open Geography portal are published in the original British National Grid (BNG) projection.  We recommend that in order to avoid anomalies of on the fly projections by different systems, you should use the service in a like-for-like projection space.  The REST end-point map services are such that when you add the map service it is immediately recognised by the client (such as ArcMap or MapInfo) as BNG projection. The map services also have WMS services for those of you who wish to use WMS (27700 BNG and WGS84).  BNG is the best option if you want a high degree of accuracy.  If you choose not to use like-for-like then you are responsible for applying the proper geodetic datum transformations. The reason being that these transformations are not always going to be accurate and are affected by the bounding box (size), geographic location, and projection parameters of the data you are trying to view.","1494":"","1495":"","1496":"","1497":"","1498":"This file contains the digital population weighted centroids for Output Areas in England and Wales as at 31 December 2011.

The Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics (NUTS) is a hierarchical classification of spatial units that provides a breakdown of the European Union's territory for the purposes of producing comparable regional statistics. There were originally 5 different NUTS levels but as from 11 July 2003, NUTS levels 4 and 5 became Local Administrative Units (LAU 1 and 2). The remaining NUTS levels 1-3 will be fixed for a few years but the LAU will not. NUTS and LAU are generally based on different levels of administrative geography. There are 168 NUTS 3 areas in Great Britain. ONS have this product dated as at January 2015, but the official Eurostat terminology for this product is NUTS 2013. For further information on Eurostat dating of products, please see the link below. Please note that NUTS 3 do not have the GSS-nine character codes as Eurostat use only their own five character codes. The boundaries are Intermediate\/Generalised (20m). Intermediate datasets are designed for high quality mapping, preserving much of the original detail from the full dataset, but typically 10% of the file size. They are great when used in conjunction with the OS raster products and for producing detailed regional and local maps, or large wall maps. They are also suitable for non-demanding GIS analyses (such as buffering). Intermediate datasets are a good compromise between detail and small file size. They have also been clipped to the coastline (Mean High Water mark), giving the coastline a more orthodox appearance. Please note that this product contains both Ordnance Survey and ONS Intellectual Property Rights.  The map services on the Open Geography portal are published in the original British National Grid (BNG) projection.  We recommend that in order to avoid anomalies of on the fly projections by different systems, you should use the service in a like-for-like projection space.  The REST end-point map services are such that when you add the map service it is immediately recognised by the client (such as ArcMap or MapInfo) as BNG projection. The map services also have WMS services for those of you who wish to use WMS (27700 BNG and WGS84).  BNG is the best option if you want a high degree of accuracy.  If you choose not to use like-for-like then you are responsible for applying the proper geodetic datum transformations. The reason being that these transformations are not always going to be accurate and are affected by the bounding box (size), geographic location, and projection parameters of the data you are trying to view.","1520":"<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt; font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif; color:black;'>This file contains the digital vector\nboundaries for Parishes and Non Civil Parished Areas in England and Wales as at December 2021.<\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt; font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif; color:black;'>The boundaries available are: (BFC) Full - clipped to the coastline (Mean High Water mark).<\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt; font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif; color:black;'>Contains both Ordnance Survey and ONS\nIntellectual Property Rights.<\/span><\/p>","1521":"","1522":"This file contains the digital vector boundaries for Parishes and Non Civil Parished areas in England and Wales, as at 31st December 2019.

Parishes are subdivisions of local authority districts in many parts of England, and their councils are the most local level of government. Unlike electoral wards\/divisions however, parishes are not found in all parts of England. Communities are subdivisions of Welsh unitary authorities and their councils and are the most local level of government in Wales. They are the equivalent of (civil) parishes in England, but unlike their English counterparts, communities cover the whole of Wales. Unparished, or non-civil parish (NCP) areas are the remaining area of each local authority district which is not assigned to a parish in England. Parishes or communities by their nature often contain quite small population numbers. For this reason statistical methods are employed to prevent the release of any data which could identify an individual or individuals within a small parish. In addition, data may not actually be available for such a small area. Local authority district names and codes have been added to this file to help with running queries and searches. This product contains the nine character codes for parishes, communities, unparished areas and local authority districts. For further information, please see the Code History Database (CHD) (Link below). The boundaries are Intermediate\/Generalised (20m). Intermediate datasets are designed for high quality mapping, preserving much of the original detail from the full dataset, but typically 10% of the file size. They are great when used in conjunction with the OS raster products and for producing detailed regional and local maps, or large wall maps. They are also suitable for non-demanding GIS analyses (such as buffering). Intermediate datasets are a good compromise between detail and small file size. They have also been clipped to the coastline (Mean High Water mark), giving the coastline a more orthodox appearance.

The Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics (NUTS) is a hierarchical classification of spatial units that provides a breakdown of the European Union's territory for the purposes of producing comparable regional statistics. There were originally 5 different NUTS levels but as from 11 July 2003, NUTS levels 4 and 5 became Local Administrative Units (LAU 1 and 2). The remaining NUTS levels 1-3 will be fixed for a few years but the LAU will not. NUTS and LAU are generally based on different levels of administrative geography. There are 36 NUTS 2 areas in Great Britain. ONS have this product dated as at January 2012, but the official Eurostat terminology for this product is NUTS 2010. For further information on Eurostat dating of products, please see the link below. Please note that NUTS 2 do not have the nine character codes as Eurostat use only their own four character codes. Super generalised boundaries are designed for national mapping where high levels of detail are not required. They have very small file sizes which also makes them suitable for mapping on the web. They should not be used for GIS analyses. They have also been clipped to the coastline (Mean High Water mark), giving the coastline a more orthodox appearance.

These 228 TTWAs covering the whole of the UK were defined using 2011 Census commuting flow data, indicating home and workplace address, and in some cases span country borders. This product contains the nine-character GSS codes only. Super generalised boundaries are designed for national mapping where high levels of detail are not required. They have very small file sizes which also makes them suitable for mapping on the web. They should not be used for GIS analyses. They have also been clipped to the coastline (Mean High Water mark), giving the coastline a more orthodox appearance.

Urban Audit is a Eurostat geography and therefore boundaries are not allocated a GSS nine-character code. Urban Audit defines a harmonised geography across Europe for the collection of data about urban areas. It features 160 'core cities' in Great Britain. Of these, 11 have a 'greater city' area, while 38 have a 'functional urban area'. All boundaries are based on local authority districts (LADs) in England and Wales, or council areas in Scotland. The boundaries are Intermediate\/Generalised (20m). Intermediate datasets are designed for high quality mapping, preserving much of the original detail from the full dataset, but typically 10% of the file size. They are great when used in conjunction with the OS raster products and for producing detailed regional and local maps, or large wall maps. They are also suitable for non-demanding GIS analyses (such as buffering). Intermediate datasets are a good compromise between detail and small file size. They have also been clipped to the coastline (Mean High Water mark), giving the coastline a more orthodox appearance. Please note that this product contains both Ordnance Survey and ONS Intellectual Property Rights.","1909":"<div>This file contains the digital vector boundaries for Travel to Work Areas in the United Kingdom as at December 2011.\u00a0<\/div><div><br \/><\/div><div>The boundaries available are:\u00a0<\/div><div>Full resolution - extent of the realm (usually this is the Mean Low Water mark but in some cases boundaries extend beyond this to include off shore islands);\u00a0<\/div><div>Full resolution - clipped to the coastline (Mean High Water mark);\u00a0<\/div><div>Generalised (20m) - clipped to the coastline (Mean High Water mark);\u00a0<\/div><div>Super generalised (200m) - clipped to the coastline (Mean High Water mark) and\u00a0<\/div><div>Ultra generalised (500m) - clipped to the coastline (Mean High Water mark).\u00a0<\/div><div><br \/><\/div><div>Contains both Ordnance Survey and ONS Intellectual Property Rights.\u00a0<\/div><div><br \/><\/div><div>Download File Sizes<\/div><div>Full resolution - extent of the realm (64 MB)<\/div><div>Full resolution - clipped to the coastline (68 MB)<\/div><div>Generalised (20m) - clipped to the coastline (6 MB)<\/div><div>Super generalised (200m) - clipped to the coastline (1 MB)<\/div><div>Ultra generalised (500m) - clipped to the coastline (382 KB).<\/div><div><br \/><\/div><div><\/div>","1910":"","1911":"","1912":"","1913":"","1914":"This file contains the digital vector boundaries for Urban Audit Functional Urban Areas, in the United Kingdom, as at December 2016.

Urban Audit is a Eurostat geography and therefore boundaries have not been allocated a GSS nine-character code. Urban Audit defines a harmonised geography across Europe for the collection of data about urban areas. It features 160 'core cities' in Great Britain. Of these, 11 have a 'greater city' area, while 38 have a 'functional urban area'. All boundaries are based on local authority districts (LADs) in England and Wales, or council areas in Scotland. The boundaries are Intermediate\/Generalised (20m). Intermediate datasets are designed for high quality mapping, preserving much of the original detail from the full dataset, but typically 10% of the file size. They are great when used in conjunction with the OS raster products and for producing detailed regional and local maps, or large wall maps. They are also suitable for non-demanding GIS analyses (such as buffering). Intermediate datasets are a good compromise between detail and small file size. They have also been clipped to the coastline (Mean High Water mark), giving the coastline a more orthodox appearance. Please note that this product contains both Ordnance Survey and ONS Intellectual Property Rights. This file supersedes the original 'Urban Audit larger urban zones (2011) GB Boundaries (Generalised, Clipped)' version, with the only change being that the Urban Audit larger urban zones are now known as Urban Audit functional urban areas. The boundaries, names and codes have not changed.","1943":"This file contains the digital vector boundaries for electoral wards\/divisions in Great Britain as at December 2015.

Urban Audit is a Eurostat geography and therefore boundaries are not allocated a GSS nine-character code. Urban Audit defines a harmonised geography across Europe for the collection of data about urban areas. It features 160 'core cities' in Great Britain. Of these, 11 have a 'greater city' area, while 38 have a 'functional urban area'. All boundaries are based on local authority districts (LAD) in England and Wales, or council areas in Scotland. The boundaries are Intermediate\/Generalised (20m). Intermediate datasets are designed for high quality mapping, preserving much of the original detail from the full dataset, but typically 10% of the file size. They are great when used in conjunction with the OS raster products and for producing detailed regional and local maps, or large wall maps. They are also suitable for non-demanding GIS analyses (such as buffering). Intermediate datasets are a good compromise between detail and small file size. They have also been clipped to the coastline (Mean High Water mark), giving the coastline a more orthodox appearance.

Electoral wards\/divisions are the key building block of administrative geography in Great Britain. They are the spatial units used to elect local government councillors in metropolitan and non-metropolitan districts, unitary authorities and London boroughs in England; unitary authorities in Wales; and council areas in Scotland. Electoral wards are found in Scotland, Wales and most of England but in the Isle of Wight and some unitary authorities the equivalent areas are legally termed 'electoral divisions', although they are frequently also referred to as wards. The only part of Great Britain without electoral wards\/divisions is the Isles of Scilly, which has its own council but no electoral zoning. For statistical purposes however, ONS treats the islands' five parishes as electoral wards. Electoral wards\/divisions (and the Scilly parishes) cover the whole of Great Britain and all higher administrative units are necessarily built up from them. They are also used to constitute many other geographies such as NUTS areas and Westminster parliamentary constituencies. Electoral ward\/division boundary changes are usually enacted on the first Thursday in May each year, to coincide with the local government elections. This product contains both the nine character codes as well as the old style six character codes. For further information, please see the Code History Database (CHD) (Link below). The boundaries are Intermediate\/Generalised (20m). Intermediate datasets are designed for high quality mapping, preserving much of the original detail from the full dataset, but typically 10% of the file size. They are great when used in conjunction with the OS raster products and for producing detailed regional and local maps, or large wall maps. They are also suitable for non-demanding GIS analyses (such as buffering). Intermediate datasets are a good compromise between detail and small file size. They have also been clipped to the coastline (Mean High Water mark), giving the coastline a more orthodox appearance.

Workplace zones are referred to as 2011 workplace zones. Workplace zones are used across England and Wales as the base building block geography for the publication of 2011 Census workplace outputs. Workplace zones are based on maintained 2011 OA which are then merged or split using thresholds of workers or workplace postcodes. Where an OA contains less than 100 workers or three workplace postcodes, it will be merged with adjacent OA to produce a non-disclosure unit. Where an OA contains more than 625 workers, attempts will be made to split it down using building blocks composed of workplace postcodes.

It includes non-metropolitan districts, metropolitan districts, unitary authorities and London boroughs in England; and Welsh unitary authorities. The areas are made up of whole electoral wards\/divisions.

The map services on the Open Geography portal are published in the original British National Grid (BNG) projection. We recommend that in order to avoid anomalies of on the fly projections by different systems, you should use the service in a like-for-like projection space. The REST end-point map services are such that when you add the map service it is immediately recognised by the client (such as ArcMap or MapInfo) as BNG projection. The map services also have WMS services for those of you who wish to use WMS (27700 BNG and WGS84). BNG is the best option if you want a high degree of accuracy. If you choose not to use like-for-like then you are responsible for applying the proper geodetic datum transformations. The reason being that these transformations are not always going to be accurate and are affected by the bounding box (size), geographic location, and projection parameters of the data you are trying to view.\n","2134":"<span style='color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Lato, &quot;Avenir Next&quot;; font-size: 16px;'>This file contains the names and codes for Westminster parliamentary constituencies in the United Kingdom as at 31 December 2019. \u00a0(File Size - 72 KB)\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><br \/><span style='color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Lato, &quot;Avenir Next&quot;; font-size: 16px;'>Field Names - PCON19CD, PCON19NM, FID<\/span><div><span style='color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Lato, &quot;Avenir Next&quot;; font-size: 16px;'>Field Types - Text, Text<\/span><\/div><div><span style='color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Lato, &quot;Avenir Next&quot;; font-size: 16px;'>Field Lengths - 9, 41<\/span><\/div><div><p style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\nnormal'><span style='font-size:11.5pt;font-family:&quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;\ncolor:black;background:white'>FID =\u00a0The FID, or Feature ID is created by\nthe publication process when the names and codes \/ lookup products are\npublished to the Open Geography portal.\u00a0<\/span><span style='font-size:11.5pt;font-family:&quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;mso-fareast-font-family:\n&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;color:#4C4C4C'><\/span><\/p><span style='color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Lato, &quot;Avenir Next&quot;; font-size: 16px;'><\/span><\/div>","2135":"<span style='font-family: &quot;Avenir Next W01&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next W00&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next&quot;, Avenir, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;'>This file contains the digital vector boundaries for Westminster Parliamentary Constituencies in the UK, as at 31 December 2017. \u00a0The boundaries available are:\u00a0<\/span><div style='font-family: &quot;Avenir Next W01&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next W00&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next&quot;, Avenir, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;'><ul><li>Super generalised (200m) - clipped to the coastline (Mean High Water mark) and\u00a0<\/li><\/ul><\/div><div style='font-family: &quot;Avenir Next W01&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next W00&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next&quot;, Avenir, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;'><br \/><\/div><div style='font-family: &quot;Avenir Next W01&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next W00&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next&quot;, Avenir, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;'>Contains both Ordnance Survey and ONS Intellectual Property Rights.\u00a0<\/div><div style='font-family: &quot;Avenir Next W01&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next W00&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next&quot;, Avenir, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;'><br \/><\/div><div style='font-family: &quot;Avenir Next W01&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next W00&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next&quot;, Avenir, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;'><\/div>","2136":"<span style='font-family: &quot;Avenir Next W01&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next W00&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next&quot;, Avenir, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;'>This file contains the digital vector boundaries for Westminster Parliamentary Constituencies in the UK, as at 31 December 2017. \u00a0The boundaries available are:\u00a0<\/span><div style='font-family: &quot;Avenir Next W01&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next W00&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next&quot;, Avenir, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;'><font style='font-family: inherit;'><br \/><\/font><div><ul><li>Full resolution - clipped to the coastline (Mean High Water mark);\u00a0<\/li><\/ul><\/div><div><br \/><\/div><div>Contains both Ordnance Survey and ONS Intellectual Property Rights.\u00a0<\/div><div><br \/><\/div><div><\/div><\/div>","2137":"This file contains the digital vector boundaries for Westminster Parliamentary Consitituencies in the United Kingdom, as at December 2018.

Electoral wards\/divisions are the key building block of administrative geography in Great Britain. They are the spatial units used to elect local government councillors in metropolitan and non-metropolitan districts, unitary authorities and the London boroughs in England; unitary authorities in Wales; and council areas in Scotland. Electoral wards are found in Scotland and most of England but in Wales, the Isle of Wight and some of the new unitary authorities the equivalent areas are legally termed 'electoral divisions', although they are frequently also referred to as wards. The only part of Great Britain without electoral wards\/divisions is the Isles of Scilly, which has its own council but no electoral zoning. For statistical purposes however, ONS treats the islands' five parishes as electoral wards. Electoral wards\/divisions (and the Scilly parishes) cover the whole of Great Britain and all higher administrative units are necessarily built up from them. They are also used to constitute many other geographies such as NUTS areas and Westminster parliamentary constituencies. Electoral ward\/division boundary changes are usually enacted on the first Thursday in May each year, to coincide with the local government elections. This product contains both the nine character codes as well as the old style six character codes. For further information, please see the Code History Database (CHD) (Link below). The boundaries are Intermediate\/Generalised (20m). Intermediate datasets are designed for high quality mapping, preserving much of the original detail from the full dataset, but typically 10% of the file size. They are great when used in conjunction with the OS raster products and for producing detailed regional and local maps, or large wall maps. They are also suitable for non-demanding GIS analyses (such as buffering). Intermediate datasets are a good compromise between detail and small file size. They have also been clipped to the coastline (Mean High Water mark), giving the coastline a more orthodox appearance. Please note that this product contains both Ordnance Survey and ONS Intellectual Property Rights.","2140":"This file contains the digital vector boundaries for Westminster Parliamentary Constituencies in the United Kingdom, as at December 2018.
